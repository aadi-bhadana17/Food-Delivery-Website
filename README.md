# **Food Delivery App** - Full Stack (Backend heavy)

## Overview
A backend-focused academic project inspired by food delivery platforms like Swiggy. Built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication to learn real-world backend architecture, API design, database modeling, and clean code practices. Features role-based access control (CUSTOMER, RESTAURANT_OWNER, ADMIN) with a focus on mastering backend fundamentals over feature complexity.

## Current Progress
✅ **Authentication & Authorization** - JWT-based auth with role-based access control  
✅ **User Management** - Signup, login, role change requests with admin approval workflow  
✅ **Restaurant Management** - CRUD operations with owner verification and status management  
✅ **Category Management** - Menu categories with owner-only access and proper validation  

## Tech Stack
- Java 17+ with Spring Boot
- Spring Security with JWT
- PostgreSQL + JPA/Hibernate
- Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- Maven for dependency management
