### `FEB 2nd`

I created model package
By the help of that youtuber - code with Josh

But I notice few things that 
* he is doing hard coding, I mean like initializing user's role - CUSTOMER by default
* also he was using String at many places, where ENUM should be used
so, I change that too - I create ENUMS like PaymentStatus etc. total 4

* then I add other fields too in diff classes

and mainly focus on Relationships b/w Classes (tables in db)
Even tough I didn't do many mistakes in them, but I did in CASCADING
I take help from ChatGpt and Claude, I argue with them too about CASCADING of those tables

And that's how my  **_`DAY 1`_** ends


### `FEB 3rd `

Today, I start to create Security Config for my project with the help of youtuber

But soon I realised that today I'm doing blind coding, I mean all I was doing copy and paste
So, I stop the video and start creating config by myself

I go through from the codes I write while learning Security,
but I get so much confused and spend so much time in learning about each method and its replicas
and it's flaws that whole time spend and I barely write a code

### `FEB 4th`

MOST IMP DAY SO FAR

Today I just gave up on video and start to write code on my own
I create classes - JstService, JwtTokenValidator, AppConfig

fail few times but in end I write them successfully

Later today, I start to work on controllers, - AuthController
I learn about DTOs too, 
create 3 of them - SignupRequestDto, LoginRequestDto, AuthResponse
create signup method and test it

### `FEB 5th`

Woke up at 2 AM and after scrolling reels for 1 hour, start to work at 3 AM

I create login method, test it, implements password encoder
